WHEN UBUNTU OS IS HAVING SYSTEM WIDE MAJOR ISSUES AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO !

1. TRY TO RESTORE SYSTEM FROM APT PACKAGE MANAGER
    sudo apt --fix-broken install

    sudo apt --fix-missing install

    sudo apt-get install --reinstall <package-name>

2. Address Potential Dependency Issues:
    If you encounter dependency issues, try to fix them:
    
  $ sudo apt --fix-broken install

    If that doesn't work, you might need to remove and reinstall specific packages that have unmet dependencies.

  Check for missing packages:-  $ sudo apt --fix-missing install

3. Investigate the Cause of Instability:
    Check system logs: Examine /var/log/syslog and /var/log/dpkg.log 
      for error messages that might indicate the cause of the instability.
    Look for corrupted files: Use sudo fsck -y / to check and repair the file system.
    Check for disk space issues: Run df -h to see if your hard drive is full. 

4. Consider Reverting Changes (If Necessary):
    If you are unable to fix the instability, you may need to revert to a previous state
    by restoring a backup or reinstalling the system.
    Create a backup: Before making any major changes, create a backup of your important data.
    Restore from backup: If you have a backup, restore your system to a previous state.
    Reinstall the system: If all else fails, reinstall Ubuntu 22.04.

5. Additional Tips:
    Use apt with caution: Be careful when using apt remove or apt purge as you can accidentally remove essential packages.
    Consult the Ask Ubuntu forum: Ask Ubuntu for similar issues.
    Check for updates: Make sure your system is up to date. 

  $ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

    Use a live USB: If you cannot boot into your system, boot from a live USB to check the system.
